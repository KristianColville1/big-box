<!--
    The aria-labelledby attribute establishes relationships between objects and their labels.
     The value given to the aria-labelledby attribute should be one or more element IDs, 
     which refer to elements that have the text needed for labelling.

Screen readers use this attribute to catalogue the objects in a document so that
 users can navigate between them. Without an element ID, the assistive technology 
 cannot catalog the object.

 If you can use the aria-labelledby attribute on an <img> element, its alt
  attribute should be an empty value.

  It is not necessary to use aria-label if aria-labelledby can be used if both are 
  included screenreaders will always give precedence to aria-labelledby.

        Ada Lovelace was the first person to publish an algorithm intended to be executed by the first modern computer,
         the Analytical Engine created by Charles Babbage. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
