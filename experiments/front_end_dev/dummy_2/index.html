        <h2>What is a rubiks cube?</h2>
        <p>It is, in essence, a cube. Each side of the rubiks cube is a distinct hue, usually red, blue, yellow, green, orange, and white. 
            The Rubik's Cube is a three-dimensional combination puzzle created in 1974 by Ern Rubik, a Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture.
