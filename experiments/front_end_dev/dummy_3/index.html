            <h2>What is Money afterall?</h2>
            <p>Well the current dictionary term defines it as a current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes; coins and banknotes collectively.</p>
            <p>So all it is a form of exchange, Money serves as a medium of exchange, as a store of value, and as a unit of account. Medium of exchange. Money's most important function is as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions.</p>

            <h2>How do we understand Money?</h2>
            <p>Currency is a term used to describe money. Each government has its own money system in terms of economics. Cryptocurrencies are also being created around the world for funding and international exchange.</p>
            
            <p>Money is a liquid asset used in the settlement of transactions. It functions based on the general acceptance of its value within a governmental economy and internationally through foreign exchange. 
                The current value of monetary currency is not necessarily derived from the materials used to produce the note or coin. 
                Instead, value is derived from the willingness to agree to a displayed value and rely on it for use in future transactions. This is money's primary function: a generally recognized medium of exchange that people and global 
                economies intend to hold, and are willing to accept as payment for current or future transactions.
            </p>
            
            <p>For the sake of exchange, economic money systems began to be devised. The use of money as a medium of exchange in a market provides a centralized means for buying and selling. This was created to take the place of bartering. 
                The use of monetary currency aids in the development of a system for overcoming the double coincidence of desires. In a barter system, where one side must have something that the other wants in order to trade, the double coincidence of wants is a common difficulty.
                 This dilemma can be avoided if all parties utilize and readily accept an agreed-upon monetary currency.</p>
            
             <p>A currency should be 1) fungible, 2) durable, 3) portable, 4) identifiable, and 5) stable in order to be most useful as money. These features ensure that the benefit of lowering or eliminating the transaction cost of the double
                    coincidence of demands is not offset by other transaction costs connected with that particular product.</p>
            <h2>So what's Fungible about money?</h2>
            <p>The quality of the units of the good should be somewhat consistent so that they can be interchanged. If multiple units of an item have varying attributes, their value in future transactions may not be constant or dependable. 
                Trying to use a non-fungible item as money incurs transaction costs since each unit of the good must be individually evaluated before an exchange can take place.</p>
